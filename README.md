# 📊 LangAnalyzer

**LangAnalyzer** is a lightweight, dependency-free Python library that scans any project folder, calculates **file sizes by extension**, and provides a **percentage breakdown** — similar to GitHub's language statistics.

## ✨ Features

*   **Recursive Directory Scanning**: Automatically scans all files within a given directory and its subdirectories.
*   **Extension-Based Analysis**: Groups and calculates statistics based on file extensions.
*   **Percentage & Size Breakdown**: Returns both the raw size (in bytes) and percentage for each file type.
*   **Customizable Ignore List**: Skip irrelevant directories (like `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`) to focus on your source code.
*   **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Python with no external libraries required.
*   **Simple API**: One primary function for easy integration into your tools or workflows.

## 📦 Installation

You can install LangAnalyzer directly from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install LangAnalyzer
```

Alternatively, install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnavsaxena62/langanalyzer.git
cd langanalyzer
pip install .
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get a language breakdown of any directory in just a few lines of code.

```python
from LangAnalyzer import analyze_directory
import pprint

# Analyze a directory (e.g., a JavaScript project)
result = analyze_directory("/path/to/your/project")

# Pretty print the results
pprint.pprint(result)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
{
    'sizes': {
        '.js': 5234512,
        '.html': 10243,
        '.css': 2483,
        '.png': 122993
    },
    'percentages': {
        '.js': 92.13,
        '.html': 0.18,
        '.css': 0.04,
        '.png': 7.65
    },
    'total_size': 5360231
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Note on Analysis Method

**Please be aware:** LangAnalyzer calculates statistics based **solely on file extensions and sizes**. This is a different method from GitHub's own analysis, which:
*   Uses the [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) library.
*   Identifies programming languages based on file content and shebangs, not just extensions.
*   Ignores vendor files, documentation, and generated files in its percentages.

Therefore, the percentages generated by LangAnalyzer may differ significantly from those shown on GitHub. It is best used for quick, extension-based overviews rather than precise language analysis.
